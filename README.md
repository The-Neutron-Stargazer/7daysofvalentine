# 7daysofvalentine
# some Python codes for her

# I will try to make some files for each day of the 7th in Valentine's week. I am a newbie in programming, please be nice. I have used some Chat-GPT, 
# but I am adapting things I am learning in my Computational Methods class. 

# This is totally dedicated to you, Ushi. I love you and I will cherish you forever.
